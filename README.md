# Semantic Search Engine using ANNs & Recommender System

This project focuses on exploring and implementing advanced concepts and techniques in information retrieval and recommender systems. The primary objectives are to develop a semantic search engine using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), explore alternative models for text search, and design a recommender system based on lecture transcripts.

## Note
This project was completed on COLAB, therefore MovieLens dataset direcotry is set to google drive. If need to run on local please update `MOVIELENS_DIR` variable. Thanks!
